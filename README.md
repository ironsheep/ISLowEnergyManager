*NOTE: it’s been a while since I’ve been playing with this code. I’m
revisiting it now to ensure I’ve posted the latest working code. I’ll
update the following status as each piece is completed over the next
couple of days… (posted 22 Aug 2014)*

-   -   —\> Ipad i/f is not yet setup...

    -   Current code compiles and runs but finds the first (likely wrong
        Bluetooth LE device) instead of the desired device. - This says
        this isn’t my latest version of this manager.
